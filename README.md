CovidSafe is a tool built by doctors and researchers at the University of Washington with Microsoft volunteers to alert you about highly relevant public health announcements, exposure to COVID-19, and to assist contact tracing without compromising your personal privacy.

Here is a video demonstrating how users are notified of potential exposures and announcements:

Details for how to do this can be found in the wiki

Our tool is built upon the following white paper:

Our tool sends out Bluetooth IDs that are randomized every 15 minutes:
